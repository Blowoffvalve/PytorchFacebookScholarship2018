# Deep Learning Image classification algorithm with (PyTorch) using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

The notebook was used to train a deep learning image classifier to classify images of flowers into 102 classes. This notebook is modifed to be ***self-contained to work in colab***. 

## Accuracy on test set
   2019-01-06: 92%

## Follow these steps to use the notebook in colab
* Go to google colab website (https://colab.research.google.com) and sign in
* You will be greeted by this dialog (if not you can use CTRL+o or from file menu select open notebook)

1. select GITHUB
2. For GitHub URL type *https://github.com/blowoffvalve* and click the search button
3. In the Repository drop-down menu select blowoffvalve/project-flower-classification

* You will get a list of the available notebooks select the on you want to work on and click it to open in colab env


* To work in **GPU** go to the **Runtime menus** select **Change runtime type**


* Change the hardware accelerator to **GPU** and hit SAVE


* If you don't see the green check mark and the word connected at the top right corner of the page click in the connect button and wait for it to connect

***The changes to notebooks from Github will not be saved you need to copy them to your google drive to save any changes made***

### An alternative way: clone the repo or download it as zip file and unzip them to your local machine
* Instead of using the GITHUB tab use the UPLOAD tab and click the **Browes...** button


* Browse to the location where you have the downloaded file


**This way they are saved automatically in your google drive**
